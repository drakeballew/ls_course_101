Ternary operators are different in that they are used to compare objects, similar to an if statement.

1. Conditional operator used to compare objects, means "not equal to"
2. This would change user_name to the opposite of its boolean equivalent (default true for most objects)

5. Ternary operator for "if...else"
6. Converts the value to its boolean equivalent
