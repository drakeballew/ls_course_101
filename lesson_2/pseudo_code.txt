### a method that returns the sum of two integers
START

# Given two integers as variables
first_integer + second_integer

END

### a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

START

# Given an array of strings called "words"

SET long_string = words at index 0
SET iterator = 1

WHILE iterator < length of words
  SET long_strong to current value plus value of words at iterator index
  iterator = iterator + 1

PRINT long_string

END

### a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

START

# Given an array of integers called 'numbers'

SET mapped_numbers = empty array
SET count = 1

WHILE count < numbers length
  SET mapped_numbers to current value plus the value at numbers' count index
  count = count + 2

print mapped_numbers
